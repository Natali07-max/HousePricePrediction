# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning models trained on the Kaggle House Prices dataset (1460 records, 81 features).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression (R² Score: 0.82)
- Random Forest Regressor (R² Score: 0.88)

Random Forest performed better and achieved 88% variance explanation.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Missing Value Handling
2. Numeric Feature Selection
3. Train-Test Split (80-20)
4. Model Training
5. Performance Evaluation using R² Score and MAE

## Results
The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression and produced more accurate predictions.
